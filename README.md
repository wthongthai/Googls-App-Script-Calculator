# Googls-App-Script-Calculator
"Earned Work Hour" Calculator that pulls data from Google Spreadsheet

Motivation:  Each project google doc used to have a "calculator" sheet that allows team members to calculate their "Earned Work Hour" (EWH) by entering # items completed.  This approach had two issues.
(1) There is no central location for the many different calculators.
(2) Only one team member can use the calculator at one time (since they are editing a shared spreadsheet).

This calculator was created to solve these two issues while preserving the advantage of updating the calculator dynamically when data is updated in the project google doc.
